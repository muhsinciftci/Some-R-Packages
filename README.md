# Some-R-Packages

This reposotory inludes some `R` packages I finds really useful for myself when working on empirical data-related jobs. 

* `lubridate` Package: This package aims to offer proper and easy ways to work with date and time in `R`. Getting known to this package helps you to be able to easliy work with time series and panel data etc. The examplary code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/muhsinciftci/Some-R-Packages/blob/master/Lubridate.md)
